  # DAB402: Air Quality Prediction
    <br>
</h1>
<p align="center">
<strong>üèÜ&nbsp; My goal was to perform to check the quality of air using ‚ÄòAir Quality Chemical Multisensor Device‚Äô by finding the R^2 score and coefficient of regression using different regression models and the best model is selected to evaluate the Air Quality..</strong>
</p>

## Objective of Project:
This is the classic marketing bank dataset uploaded originally in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset gives you information about a marketing campaign of a financial institution.
Analyze data in order to find ways to look for future strategies in order to improve future marketing campaigns for the bank.

## Research Objectives:
The following are the business objective of this application,

- **Find the Target Variable.**

- **Find the variable highly correlated with the target variable. Decide independent parameter to predict the dependent parameter for modelling.**

- **Find the best Model for Evaluating the Quality of Air with highest Accuracy Score**

## Technologies:
This project is created with:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Python
* Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, SciPy, Seaborn, Scikit Learn


## Classification & Modelling - Results:

**For designing the model for predicting Quality of Air, I have applied Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Lasso Regression.**

**When tested on test data below are MSE, RMSE and R^2 scores obtained from different algorithms:**

**Conclusion**

MSE	RMSE	R^2
Linear Regression	1.1097	1.0534	97.2476
Lasso Regression	1.0903	1.0442	97.2955
Decision Tree Regression	0.0042	0.0649	99.9895

**Result: By seeing the table we conclude that Decision Tree Regression model is giving More accuracy out of all these model so it will be considered as the best model for evaluating the Quality of Air.**
