  # DAB402: Air Quality Prediction
    <br>
</h1>
<p align="center">
<strong>üèÜ&nbsp; My goal was to perform to check the quality of air using ‚ÄòAir Quality Chemical Multisensor Device‚Äô by finding the R^2 score and coefficient of regression using different regression models and the best model is selected to evaluate the Air Quality..</strong>
</p>

## Objective of Project:
- **Pre-processing**: It is the first step to read the dataset and clean the data i.e. removing unwanted data or identifying null values. If any null values exist, we replace them with constant values or removing duplicates.

- **Exploration**: Visualizing the dataset, detect outliers, replacing a missing value and cleaning the dataset, splitting training dataset into training and testing sets and checks for any correlation among the features using heatmap. Prediction: Here we predict the quality of air by finding R^2 score using different Regression models

- **Finally, Declare that the model with the highest R^2 score on both training and testing datasets will be concluded as the best model for evaluating the Quality of Air**.

## Research Objectives:
The following are the business objective of this application,

- **Find the Target Variable.**

- **Find the variable highly correlated with the target variable. Decide independent parameter to predict the dependent parameter for modelling.**

- **Find the best Model for Evaluating the Quality of Air with highest Accuracy Score**

## Classification & Modelling - Results:

**For designing the model for predicting Quality of Air, I have applied Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Lasso Regression.**

**When tested on test data below are MSE, RMSE and R^2 scores obtained from different algorithms:**

**Conclusion**

MSE	RMSE	R^2
Linear Regression	1.1097	1.0534	97.2476
Lasso Regression	1.0903	1.0442	97.2955
Decision Tree Regression	0.0042	0.0649	99.9895

**Result: By seeing the table we conclude that Decision Tree Regression model is giving More accuracy out of all these model so it will be considered as the best model for evaluating the Quality of Air.**

## Modelling & Research answers :

> Q: Find the classification model that can be used in the future as a predictive model, that will result in higher accuracy?

In comparison with all 3 classification algorithms Decision Tree Regression outperformed Linear Regression and Lasso Regression classification by achieving the highest accuracy among all of the three classification algorithms.
So Decision Tree Regression model will be considered as the best predictive model for evaluating the Quality of Air.

> Q: Find the variable highly correlated with the target variable. Decide independent parameter to predict the dependent parameter for modelling ?

By seeing the correlation we conclude that Target variable : C6H6_GT is highly correlated to PTO8.S2_NMHC, so we take PTO8.S2_NMHC as independent parameter to predict the dependent parameter i.e., C6H6_GT
